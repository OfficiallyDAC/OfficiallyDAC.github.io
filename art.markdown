I was born in Anzio (RM), on October 19, 1991: I celebrate my birthday along with Umberto Boccioni and Pino Pascali.
My birthplace is located 200m from the sea, and I have lived in symbiosis with the water element since I was a child.

As a child, I used to draw a lot. I remember eagerly anticipating freehand drawing classes during middle school. However, from an artistic perspective, Torino is the city where I grew up. It's here that I created my first works, came into contact with the art world, and truly understood what Art means to me.

Nevertheless, my artistic production is strongly influenced by my connection to the sea, to Anzio. The geographical configuration of this stretch of the Roman coastline is quite windy, and as a result, the sea is often turbulent. Since I was a child, I've always seen a lot of white in the sea. I was particularly fascinated by the vast, glistening expanses of sand created on the shore by the ebb and flow of the long ocean waves. I saw infinite depth in these portions of sand that quickly absorbed the water. My _quasi-bianco_ originates from the pursuit of this light, which I don't define as a color, but rather as an emotional, evocative dimension in which the past merges with the present, and light penetrates the canvas deeply, recreating those infinite spaces that I've admired since childhood.

In this journey of exploration, I became passionate about artists like Pierre Soulages, Yves Klein, and Ettore Spalletti, whom I believe do not use color in the conventional sense. Their identity resides in the dimension of color.

Art, for me, is the idea. I believe in an Art that conveys powerful messages. Through my works, I speak about what I know, what I have experienced firsthand, not by choice, but out of necessity. The quasi-bianco represents, for me, a starting point, the most intimate and natural dimension from which to communicate with people. My research focuses on themes of strong social relevance, such as the identity crisis of my generation and the newer generations, the bonds in our society, the deprivation of creativity imposed on the younger generations, and the perceived gap between the real and the virtual.
