I am a lover of Art and Hard Sciences. In particular, I am active in the field of Contemporary Art, and I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Data Science at the DIAG, Sapienza University, under the supervision of Dr. Francesco Bonchi.

I earned my Bachelor's degree in Theoretical Physics from Sapienza University in 2013, followed by a Master's degree in Physics of Complex Systems from the University of Turin in 2017. Subsequently, I worked as a data scientist in the financial sector for about three years before joining the Algorithmic and Data Analytics Lab at the Fondazione ISI.

Since 2022, I have been conducting research activities in the Machine Learning Foundation team at CENTAI in Turin, Italy, led by Professor Fabio Vitale. Lastly, since 2018, I have been teaching the course "Financial Applications of Unsupervised Machine Learning" in the Master in Finance and Risk Management program at the Collegio Carlo Alberto in Turin.

In the artistic realm, my research focuses on topics of strong social relevance, such as the identity crisis of my generation and the newer generations, the bonds in today's society, the deprivation of creativity imposed on the younger generations, and the perceived gap between the real and the virtual.

In the scientific field, my interests revolve around learning causal structures from observational data and signal processing.
